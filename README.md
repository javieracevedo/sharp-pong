# Pong Clone in C# and Monogame


Simple pong clone in C# and Monogame that I made for fun, It was kinda fun, but I didn't like C# that much and having to work with visual studio was pain in the #$@#$.

*Here's a picture of the game running:*

If you want to run this (which you probable won't) you are on your own, I don't understand visual studio that good to provide steps to run it, but if you use visual studio much, you probably will find a way, BYEE!.
